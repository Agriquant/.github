# Agriquant
**Making agricultural decisions predictable in an unpredictable world.**

Agriquant is a research-driven initiative developing an **algorithmic risk & decision** platform for agriculture in **Uruguay and LATAM**.  
This repository hosts the code and experiments behind our **probabilistic risk modules** (rainfall/drought, forage/NDVI, heat-stress), our **hindcast protocol**, and the scripts that generate the **Agriquant Risk Bulletin**.

> **Status:** research stage · private data disabled by default · reproducible with public datasets only

---

## Why this exists
- Provide a *transparent* implementation of calibrated, probabilistic forecasts.
- Enforce correct **spatiotemporal validation** and **data lineage** so results are auditable.
- Ship small, useful artifacts (maps, reliability plots, PDFs) rather than glossy demos.
